Something I have realised is that the majority of enjoyment that

is derived from Slack is the non-work related offshoot channels that

pop up. 

The channel itself is only a small part of what people enjoy.

People enjoy the fact and idea that the people near them enjoy

the same things they do.

So,

What if anytime someone near you inserted a hashtag in a post,

that will create its own offshoot channel in an overflow sidebar?

This channel will operate in the exact same way comments on a post

do, but instead of commenting on a post you are brought together

by that hashtag.

The user could see both the channels that have been made recently,

as well as (maybe) stay in a channel conversion for as long as they want, 

without the users even having to be near them?
